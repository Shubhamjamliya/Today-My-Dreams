    2.  **Cart:** Add items -> View Cart -> Checkout.
    3.  **Auth:** Login/Signup via Email (with OTP) or Google.
    4.  **Order:** Place Order -> Payment (Razorpay/PhonePe likely, based on routes) -> Order Confirmation.

## 3. Implementation Details

### Backend Features
*   **Authentication:**
    *   **JWT:** Secure stateless authentication.
    *   **OTP:** Integrated Email (Nodemailer) and SMS (MSG91) for verification.
    *   **OAuth:** Google Login integration.
*   **Order System:**
    *   **Dual Storage:** Orders are saved to MongoDB **AND** a local [orders.json](file:///c:/Users/SHUBHAM/Desktop/Today-My-Dreams/Backend/data/orders.json) file for backup/redundancy.
    *   **Status Workflow:** `processing` -> `confirmed` -> `manufacturing` -> `shipped` -> `delivered`.
    *   **Notifications:** Automated emails sent on status changes.
*   **File Storage:**
    *   **Local Strategy:** Most dynamic images (products, profiles) are stored locally in `Backend/data/`.
    *   **Static Assets:** Site logos and UI assets in `Frontend/public/`.

### Frontend Features
*   **Performance:** Extensive use of `React.lazy()` for code splitting to speed up initial load.
*   **SEO:** Dynamic SEO configuration for different pages.
*   **Context API:**
    *   `AuthContext`: Manages user login state.
    *   `SellerContext`: Manages vendor state.

## 4. Key Modules (Based on Codebase)
| Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auth** | Login, Signup, OTP, Google Auth, Password Reset. |
| **Shop** | Product listing, Categories, Filtering, Search. |
| **Order** | Cart management, Checkout process, Order tracking. |

## 5. Current State & Observations
*   **Server Robustness:** The server is configured to attempt startup even if the Database connection fails (fallback mode).
*   **Data Integrity:** The "Backup to JSON" strategy for orders is unique and ensures you have a file-based record of sales even if the DB is inaccessible.
